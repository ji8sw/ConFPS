# ConFPS
A simple CLI based first person (not shooter) game, originally based on [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8skO7MFYw) and modified to my liking. Made while learning C++, forgotten about, and then uploaded now.

## Features
- Map Selection: Press F1-5 to select a map.
- Map Creation: You yourself can easily edit or create maps.
- Minimap: Know where you are at any time.
- Depth Culling: Only render nearby structures.
- & much more.
